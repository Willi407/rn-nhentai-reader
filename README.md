# **React Native NHentai Reader**

##### **This project is kinda NSFW**
##### **Only for Android. I haven't touch anything on the ios folder yet**

A very simple app to read NHentai based on React Native. This is my very first RN app,
so I apologize for any crappy codes on it.

##### **Requirements:**
Node 8 or greater is required. Targeted for Android SDK 21 (Android 5.0) \
You also need to follow React Native development requirements. Follow their starting guide.

##### **Running the project: **
`yarn` or `npm install` \
`react-native run android` or `yarn android` 

##### **Author:**

 * React Native Community
